# Learning Smart Recall / ApplicableLearningSet V1.1

This tool is the executable retrieval layer for the existing EUSTIA learning canonicals. It is **not** a second learning database.

V1.1 adds a bounded Director Feature Compiler in front of the existing retriever:

`natural-language director task -> dramatic_function -> relation_type -> spatial_action_features -> failure_mechanism -> existing LearningRetriever`

The compiler is query normalization only. It does not create learning rules, copy canonical payloads, change scope/maturity/conflict state, or replace `learning_application_gate.yaml` / `learning_recall_index.yaml` authority.

Its semantic contract is traced to the existing SOAC intermediate representation in `10_运行时/screen_observable_audible_ir_schema.yaml`, especially EventGraphIR, BlockingIR, ShotPlanIR and VisibleIR.

Runtime order:

1. Director Feature Compiler for natural-language tasks
2. hard route resolution (`director_route_index.yaml`)
3. mechanism-first structured semantic recall (`learning_recall_index.yaml`)
4. scope / maturity / model-version / conflict filters
5. `ApplicableLearningSet`
6. prompt compilation by the existing director system
7. retrieval receipt
8. pre-output gate

The compact index stores routing metadata only. Full learning payloads remain authoritative in the referenced canonical files. `--expand` expands only selected Top-K cases for prompt-context use.

V1.1 remains deterministic and fail-closed. An empty or unrecognized natural-language director description raises a feature-compilation failure instead of silently entering retrieval with four empty feature axes. Literal uses of `目标` as a creative objective do not create a locatable spatial target unless a spatial action/relation is also present.

Cross-surface regressions are canonicalized in `11_验收/director_feature_compiler_regression_cases.yaml` and CI executes that file directly, including different characters, scenes and wording that must resolve to compatible mechanisms or the same canonical learning case when such a case exists.

## CLI

Validate the existing recall index:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=tools/learning_retriever python -m learning_retriever.cli --project-root . --validate-index
```

Validate the compiler's SOAC / EventGraphIR / BlockingIR / VisibleIR dependencies:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=tools/learning_retriever python -m learning_retriever.cli --project-root . --validate-feature-compiler
```

Retrieve from a natural-language director task:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=tools/learning_retriever python -m learning_retriever.cli \
  --project-root . \
  --description "城堡大厅里卫兵面向门口逃犯追击，人物朝向不能和目标方向打架" \
  --task-id DEMO-TARGET-BINDING \
  --top-k 5 \
  --expand
```

Structured JSON tasks remain supported unchanged:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=tools/learning_retriever python -m learning_retriever.cli --project-root . --task task.json --top-k 5 --expand
```

A structured JSON task may also contain `director_task_description`; the compiler unions compiled features with any explicit structured features instead of replacing them.

A director task that reaches prompt compilation without a complete retrieval receipt, misses a mandatory hard-route case, or fails natural-language feature compilation must fail closed before output.
